Perhaps a bit of a lame first impression.
Quite sad.

Anyways, go check out my lame repositories that feature lame code written by a, well, pretty much lame, awful coder.
I have good ideas though.
(I at least I think they're good.  It's hightly possible that they aren't.)

I guess I just never get around to coding them.
(Or my skills are simply awfully lame and it takes an eternity to figure out how to code them.)

Anyways, have a great day.

PS If you happen to know some tips for building chuck for Android you're welcome to let me know. (:
